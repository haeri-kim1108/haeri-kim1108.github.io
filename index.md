# About Me
I am presently working for [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com/) as a speech AI researcher. My main research topic has recently been on-device multilingual ASR system. I received my M.S in [Electrical Engineering](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/) from [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) in [IIDS](https://iids.kaist.ac.kr/), and my B.S. in [Electrical Engineering](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/) from [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/). I am interested in developing speech models based on a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms. I have been working on automatic speech recognition (ASR), and I am currently expanding my research interests to integrating speech models with techniques from various fields, such as multimodal generative AI and SpeechLLMs.
