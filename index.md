# About Me
I am presently working for [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com/) as a speech AI researcher. My main research topic has recently been on-device multilingual ASR system. I received my M.S in Electrical Engineering from [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) in [IIDS](https://iids.kaist.ac.kr/), and my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/). I am interested in speech recognition and speech translation system. Currently, I am widening my interest to combining speech model with techniques from various fields, such as multimodal generative AI.

Below shows my [publications](#publication), [career](#career) and [projects](#project). Please refer to my [CV] for further details.
